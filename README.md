# Train-Time

This is the Train-Time Project.

It was completed for the Seventh Homework Assignment for the Coding Boot Camp.

It displays a table full of information about specific trains.

This information includes the name, destination, frequency, time of next train, and number of minutes until the next train arrives.

The data for the trains is generated by user input on an entry form.

After the input is entered and submitted, the information is stored in a firebase database which is then displayed on the aforementioned table.
